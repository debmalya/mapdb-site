Most of MapDB was written by Jan Kotek. He started this project and
pretty much runs the show.

There were many people who contributed ideas, bug fixes and
improvements. I am sorry if I forgot someone, please send me a line if
you should be here.

JDBM 1
------

MapDB is loosely based on older project called JDBM. First version was
started around 2001 and was released in 2005 at
`SourceForge <http://jdbm.sourceforge.net/>`__. There were several rewrites,
there is no code left from original JDBM 1.0 in MapDB. But it
 influenced our design and general idea.

JDBM 2 and 3
------------

JDBM stagnated until it was reanimated by Jan Kotek in 2009. JDBM 2
added Map interface and basic serialization (``SerializerBase`` in
MapDB). JDBM 3 brought NIO updates, POJO serialization and many
performance improvements.

There were many people who improved JDBM 2 & 3 (and indirectly MapDB)

-  Kevin Day sent many ideas and patches, most importantly delta
   compression in BTree and packed longs.

-  Bryan Thompson worked on concurrency branch of JDBM 1.0, and helped
   to shape JDBM

-  Thomas Mueller (H2 DB) for code review and advices.

Serialization
-------------

Serialization code
is complex and initially had lot of bugs. There were MANY people who
submitted bug-fixes and I am sorry for not listing them all. Most
importantly:

-  Nathan Sweet wrote Kryo serialization framework which inspired our
   POJO serializer to some extend(MapDB-Elsa).

-  Roman Levenstein refactored original simple POJO serializer and
   greatly improved its performance.

Collections
-----------

-  Theoretical design of BTreeMap is based on 1986 paper:
   `Concurrent operations on Bâˆ—-trees with overtaking <ttp://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0022000086900218>`__
   by Yehoshua Sagiv.

-  More practical aspects of BTreeMap implementation are based on
   `notes <http://www.doc.ic.ac.uk/~td202/>`__ and `demo
   application <http://www.doc.ic.ac.uk/~td202/btree/>`__ from Thomas
   Dinsdale-Young.

-  Java Collections are very complex to implement. We took unit tests
   from Google Collections (Guava) which was great help. Credit goes to Jared
   Levy, George van den Driessche and other Google Collections
   developers.

-  Long(Concurrent)HashMap and some other classes were taken from Apache
   Harmony and refactored for our needs.

-  Some unit tests and javadoc comes from JSR166 group

-  BTreeMap uses some code from ``ConcurrentSkipListMap`` taken from
   Apache Harmony to implement all aspects of
   ``ConcurrentNavigableMap``. Credit goes to Doug Lea and others.

-  Luc Peuvrier wrote some unit tests for ``ConcurrerentNavigableMap``
   interface.

Other
-----

-  Thanks to my wife Pinelopi for tolerating awful amount of time I
   spend on this project. Also for proof reading and general advices.

-  XTea encryption was taken from H2 Database (Thomas Mueller)

-  LZF compression was ported to Java by Thomas Mueller. Original C
   implementation was written by Marc Alexander Lehmann and Oren J.
   Maurice

-  Stanimir Simeonoff from `Riflexo <http://www.riflexo.com/>`__
   reviewed and fixed some concurrency issues.

Donations
---------

MapDB development was generously sponsored in 2014 and 2015 by
`AgilData <http://www.agildata.com>`__.

Before AgilData we got donations from:

-  Chronon Systems donated `time traveling
   debugger <http://chrononsystems.com/>`__. It is great help for fixing
   complex and hard to reproduce concurrent issues.

-  EJ-Technologies donated
   `JProfiler <http://www.ej-technologies.com/products/jprofiler/overview.html>`__.
   It is excellent tool and MapDB would not be possible without it.

-  JetBrains donated `Intellij Idea
   Ultimate <http://www.jetbrains.com/idea/>`__

-  Michael Hunger donated 100 euro.

-  Jan Venema from `Vertx.io <http://vertx.io>`__ donated 100 euro.

And several other donors.
