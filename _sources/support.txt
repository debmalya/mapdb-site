MapDB development has roadmap and limited resources. It might take some time to implement new feature or fix
less urgent bugs. We offer "express lane" in form of consulting services. That covers all work done on MapDB,
but is done much faster:

* Bug-fixing
* New features
* Performance optimizations in MapDB
* Merging more complex pull requests

We also provide general software development and services related to MapDB. That includes:

* Training
* Oversight and audit of external developers
* Refactoring of existing code to use MapDB (solve garbage collection issues, improve memory consumption)
* New storage engines for existing software
* Refactor single threaded software to use multiple cores. or work on distributed cluster etc..

For short consulting we charge **$120/hour**. Longer projects are charged per task or per day at better rate.
We work remotely, on-site consulting is possible within Europe.
