Introduction
===================

MapDB is an open source (Apache licensed), embedded Java database engine and collection framework.
It provides Maps, Sets, Lists, Queues, Bitmaps with range queries, expiration, compression and streaming.
MapDB is probably the fastest Java database, with performance comparable to ``java.util`` collections.
It also provides advanced features such as ACID transactions, snapshots, incremental backups...

This manual is a work in progress and it will be completed together with the MapDB 3.0 release.
I hope you will find it useful. I would be very happy to accept
