Getting started
===============

MapDB has very power-full API, but for 99% cases you need just two
classes:
`DBMaker <http://www.mapdb.org/apidocs/org/mapdb/DBMaker.html>`__ is
builder style factory for configuring and opening a database. It has
handful of static 'newXXX' methods for particular storage mode.
`DB <http://www.mapdb.org/apidocs/org/mapdb/DB.html>`__ represents
storage. It has methods for accessing Maps and other collections. It
also controls DB life-cycle with commit, rollback and close methods.

Best place to checkout various features of MapDB are
`Examples <https://github.com/jankotek/MapDB/tree/master/src/test/java/examples>`__.
There is also
`screencast <http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FdZmyEHcWLI>`__ which
describes most aspects of MapDB.

There is `MapDB Cheat
Sheet <http://www.mapdb.org/doc/cheatsheet.pdf>`__, on just two pages it
is quick reminder of MapDB capabilities.

Maven
-----

MapDB is in Maven Central. Just add code bellow to your pom file to use
it. You may also download jar file directly from
`repo <http://search.maven.org/#browse%7C845836981>`__.

.. code:: xml

    <dependency>
        <groupId>org.mapdb</groupId>
        <artifactId>mapdb</artifactId>
        <version>1.0.6</version>
    </dependency>

There is also repository with `daily
builds <https://oss.sonatype.org/content/repositories/snapshots/org/mapdb/mapdb/>`__:

Hello World
-----------

Hereafter is a simple example. It opens TreeMap backed by file in temp
directory, file is discarded after JVM exit:

.. code:: java

    import org.mapdb.*;
    ConcurrentNavigableMap treeMap = DBMaker.newTempTreeMap()

    // and now use disk based Map as any other Map
    treeMap.put(111,"some value")

More advanced example with configuration and write-ahead-log
transaction.

.. code:: java

        import org.mapdb.*;

        // configure and open database using builder pattern.
        // all options are available with code auto-completion.
        DB db = DBMaker.newFileDB(new File("testdb"))
                   .closeOnJvmShutdown()
                   .encryptionEnable("password")
                   .make();

        // open existing an collection (or create new)
        ConcurrentNavigableMap<Integer,String> map = db.getTreeMap("collectionName");

        map.put(1, "one");
        map.put(2, "two");
        // map.keySet() is now [1,2]

        db.commit();  //persist changes into disk

        map.put(3, "three");
        // map.keySet() is now [1,2,3]
        db.rollback(); //revert recent changes
        // map.keySet() is now [1,2]

        db.close();

What you should know
--------------------

MapDB is very simple to use, however it bites when used wrong way. Here
is list of most common usage errors and things to avoid:

-  Transactions (write-ahead-log) can be disabled with
   DBMaker.transactionDisable(), this will speedup writes. However
   without transactions store gets corrupted when not closed correctly.

-  Keys and values must be immutable. MapDB may serialize them on
   background thread, put them into instance cache... Modifying an
   object after it was stored is a bad idea.

-  MapDB relies on memory mapped files. On 32bit JVM you will need
   DBMaker.randomAccessFileEnable() configuration option to access files
   larger than 2GB. RAF introduces overhead compared to memory mapped
   files.

-  MapDB does not run defrag on background. You need to call
   ``DB.compact()`` from time to time.

-  MapDB uses unchecked exceptions. All ``IOException`` are wrapped into
   unchecked ``IOError``. MapDB has weak error handling and assumes disk
   failure can not be recovered at runtime. However this does not
   affects data safety, if you use durable commits.
