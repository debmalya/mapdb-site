DB and DBMaker
==============q

MapDB is set of loosely coupled components. One could wire classes such
as ``CacheMRU``, ``StoreWAL`` and ``BTreeMap`` manually, byt there are
two factory classes to do it for you: ``DBMaker`` and ``DB``. They use
maker (builder) pattern, so most configuration options are quickly
available via code assistant in IDE.

`DBMaker <apidocs/org/mapdb/DBMaker.html>`__ handles database
configuration, creation and opening. MapDB has several modes and
configuration options. Most of those can be set using this class.

`DB <apidocs/org/mapdb/DB.html>`__ represents opened database (or single
transaction session). It creates and opens collections . It also handles
transaction with methods such as ``commit()``, ``rollback()`` and
``close()``.

To open (or create) store use one of ``DBMaker.newXXX()`` static
methods. MapDB has more formats and modes, each ``newXXX()`` uses
different: ``newMemoryDB()`` opens in-memory database backed by
``byte[]``, ``newAppendFileDB()`` opens db which uses append-only log
files and so on.

``newXXX()`` method is followed by configuration options and ``make()``
method which applyes all options and returns ``DB`` object. This example
opens file storage with encryption enabled:

.. code:: java

      DB db = DBMaker
        .newAppendFileDB(new File("/some/file"))
        .encryptionEnable("password")
        .make();

Once you have DB you may open collection or other record. DB has two
types of factory methods:

``getXXX()`` opens existing collection (or record). If collection with
given name does not exist, it is silently created with default settings
and returned. An example:

.. code:: java

      NavigableSet treeSet = db.getTreeSet("treeSet");

``createXXX()`` creates new collection (or settings) with customized
settings. Specialized serializers, node size, entry compression and so
on affect performance a lot and they are customizable here.

.. code:: java

      Atomic.Var<Person> var = = db.createAtomicVar("mainPerson", Person.SERIALIZER);

Some ``create`` method may use builder style configuration. In that case
you may finish with two methods: ``make()`` creates new collection, if
collection with given name already exists it throws an exception.
``makerOrGet()`` is same, except if collection already exist it does not
fail, but returns existing collection.

.. code:: java

      NavigableSet<String> treeSet = db.createTreeSet("treeSet);
        .nodeSize(112)
        .serializer(BTreeKeySerializer.STRING) 
        .makeOrGet();

Transactions
------------


``DB`` has methods to handle transaction lifecycle: ``commit()``,
``rollback()`` and ``close()``.

.. code:: java

      ConcurrentNavigableMap<Integer,String> map = db.getTreeMap("collectionName");

      map.put(1,"one");
      map.put(2,"two");
      //map.keySet() is now [1,2] even before commit

      db.commit();  //persist changes into disk

      map.put(3,"three");
      //map.keySet() is now [1,2,3]
      db.rollback(); //revert recent changes
      //map.keySet() is now [1,2]

      db.close();

One ``DB`` object represents single transactions. Examples above use
single global transaction, which is sufficient for some usages. MapDB
support concurrent transactions as well with full serializable
isolation, optimistic locking and MVCC snapshots. In that case we need
one extra factory which creates transactions: ``TxMaker``. We use
``DBMaker`` to create it, but instead of ``make()`` we call
``makeTxMaker()``

.. code:: java

      TxMaker txMaker = DBMaker
        .newMemoryDB()
        .makeTxMaker();

And ``TxMaker`` is than used to create multiple ``DB`` objects, each
representing single transaction:

.. code:: java

      DB tx0 = txMaker.makeTx();
      Map map0 = tx0.getTreeMap("testMap");
      map0.put(0,"zero");

      DB tx1 = txMaker.makeTx();
      Map map1 = tx1.getTreeMap("testMap");
      
      DB tx2 = txMaker.makeTx();
      Map map2 = tx1.getTreeMap("testMap");
        
      map1.put(1,"one");
      map2.put(2,"two");
      
      //each map sees only its modifications,
      //map1.keySet() contains [0,1]
      //map2.keySet() contains [0,2]
      
      //persist changes
      tx1.commit();
      tx2.commit();  
      // second commit fails  with write conflict, both maps share single BTree node, 
      // this does not happend on large maps with sufficent number of BTree nodes.
