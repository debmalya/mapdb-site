----------
We have successfully finished our consultation session with Jan Kotek
for MapDB integration. With Jan's help we've successfully ran our
mapping task using mapDB after weeks of failing to do this using any
other method (and we've tried many).

It was my first use of MapDB, and for the first time I learned about
the big limitations of the java collections and since using MongoDB was
also not efficient due to the huge amount of IO required. MapDB was the
perfect solution for us.

It was a great pleasure to work with Jan, he is an amazing
professional
