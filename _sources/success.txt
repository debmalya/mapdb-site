Who is using MapDB
=============================

See who is using MapDB and what they sey about it.

MapDB started under name JDBM in 1999. Current MapDB 2 is fifth generation.

We have successfully finished our consultation session with Jan Kotek
for MapDB integration. With Jan's help we've successfully ran our
mapping task using mapDB after weeks of failing to do this using any
other method (and we've tried many).

It was my first use of MapDB, and for the first time I learned about
the big limitations of the java collections and since using MongoDB was
also not efficient due to the huge amount of IO required. MapDB was the
perfect solution for us.

It was a great pleasure to work with Jan, he is an amazing
professional

MapDB has been a fantastic resource, allowing us to transparently move
traditionally a SQL-backed application into main memory for performance.
It's easy to use, and the examples are quite good. It definitely follows
the principle of least surprise. It actually surprised me that things "just worked",
and required very little effort to get going.

I replaced a 6-table system, relations, secondary indexes, and all into MapDB.
It was quite simple and blazing fast.

OpenStreet map import
-----------------------

 MapDB is great product. Today I finished importing file planet.osm.pbf from OpenStreetMap project that is ~27GB huge. All data after import with spatial index and simple search index by names took only ~60GB. The best thing is that it only took 3.5 hours!!!!

Configuration: pre MapDB 2.0 alpha 1, Java 8 x86_64, Xmx: ~5GB, SSD disk, CPU up to 4 cores

This is only first run with these data but it looks very promising. It's a shame that now I have to work on another project. So I can continue with MapDB and OSM data on spare time :-(. Later on I will test latest MapDB 2.0.

Thank you very much

OpenTripPlanner
-----------------

First, thanks for all your work on MapDB.
It is becoming an essential part of our work on the
`OpenTripPlanner project <https://github.com/opentripplanner/OpenTripPlanner>`_
and `our other geospatial/transport analysis work <http://conveyal.com/>`_.
We are currently modifying OpenTripPlanner to use MapDB
for its street and public transport schedule import step.
