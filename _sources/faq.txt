What is MapDB?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
MapDB is hybrid between Java Collection framework and embedded database engine.
One one side it can run on-heap with performance comparable to ``java.util`` collections.
On other side it can be traditional database engine with ACID concurrent transactions and
MVCC isolation.
MapDB is like a lego, there are several configurations between those two sides.
