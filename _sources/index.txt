MapDB: Database Engine
=================================

MapDB is an embedded database engine for Java.
It provides Maps and other collections backed by disk or off-heap memory storage.
MapDB is free under Apache License.

MapDB is not a database, but an engine. It is not complete solution, but set of building blocks
such as: memory allocators, caches, storages, indexes, transaction wrappers, serializers etc.
This gives MapDB lot of flexibility and space for performance optimizations.
Ever wanted off-heap cache with limited size and with disk overflow after expiry? Now its easy.

MapDB also has very user friendly API. In many cases it is drop-in replacement for existing Java classes,
for example on-heap Map can be replaced with off-heap Map, with just 20 characters.
It is a pure-java 500K JAR with no dependencies.

    DB db = DBMaker.newMemoryDB().make();

    ConcurrentNavigableMap treeMap = db.getTreeMap("map");
